# Gene Prediction Tool
This tool is designed to predict the presence of genes in a DNA sequence provided in FASTA format. The prediction results will be saved in a BED file.

Instructions
Installing Required Libraries

Make sure you have all the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using the command:

bash
Copy code
pip install biopython
Usage

Run the program by passing the path to the FASTA file as an argument:

bash
Copy code
python gene_prediction.py input.fasta
The prediction results will be saved in the predicted_genes.bed file.

Additions

In addition to the BED file with predicted genes, you can provide information about the identified genes and proteins in FASTA format.
Additional data or algorithms can be used to improve the prediction accuracy.
